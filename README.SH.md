# Very Important Commands

## Help, I'm new to Linux!

Linux uses a slash `/` instead of a backslash `\\` in paths. A `/` at
the beginning indicates a root directory, similar to DOS `C:`, `D:` etc.
Difference: There is only one root `/`.

On Linux `Readme.md` is not the same file as `readme.md`!

Use <TAB> for auto-completion.

In which directory am I?
```
pwd        will show you
```

How do I change directories?

```
cd <path>  similar to DOS
cd ..      goes to parent directory, like in DOS
cd..       does not work
```

How do I list directory contents?

```
ls         lists all files in a directory, comparable to dir in DOS 
ls -l      formats as list
ls -a      shows all files, including hidden files, which begin with a .
ls -la     same as ls -l -a
```

How can I display or edit the content of a text file?

```
cat <filename>    Will print the files content to the screen.
```

```
nano <filename>   Nano is one of several text-editors.
vim <filename>    Vim is nothing for beginners. Seriously...
```
