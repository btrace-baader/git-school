There was a young rustic named Mallory
who drew but a very small salary,
  When he went to the show,
  his purse made him go
to a seat in the uppermost gallery.

Lenny, named after his father
should've checked in all his files but rather,
  Forgot to do so,
  Which made his boss throw
This little boy out on the 'strada'.
